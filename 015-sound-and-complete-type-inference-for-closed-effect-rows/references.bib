  abstract  = {Most programming languages in use today let one freely use arbitrary (side) effects. This is despite the fact that unknown and unrestricted side effects are the cause of many software problems. We propose a programming model where effects are treated in a disciplined way, and where the potential side-effects of a function are apparent in its type signature. In contrast to most effect systems that are meant for internal compiler optimizations, our system is designed to be used by the programmer. Inspired by Haskell, we use a coarse-grained hierarchy of effects, like |Pure| and |IO|, which makes it convenient to read and write type signatures. The type and effect of expressions can also be inferred automatically, and we describe a polymorphic type inference system based on Hindley-Milner style inference.},

                  Algebraic effect handlers are a powerful way to incorporate effects in a
                  programming language. Sometimes perhaps even _too_ powerful. In this
                  article we define a restriction of general effect handlers with _scoped
                  resumptions_. We argue one can still express all important effects, while
                  improving reasoning about effect handlers. Using the newly gained
                  guarantees, we define a sound and coherent evidence translation for effect handlers,
                  which directly passes the handlers as evidence to each operation. We
                  prove full soundness and coherence of the translation into plain lambda calculus. The
                  evidence in turn enables efficient implementations of effect operations;
                  in particular, we show we can execute tail-resumptive operations _in
                  place_ (without needing to capture the evaluation context), and how we
                  can replace the runtime search for a handler by indexing with a constant
                  offset.},
